# TODO
- Card text Markdown rendering.
    - Try https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown to render Markdown.
    - Render embeds for links to sites that specify them.
- Make it so tags have colors that are based on category. Initial color is generated from category name, but can be changed. Color is shown on tags on cards, and next to categories in the sidebar.
